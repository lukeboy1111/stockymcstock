# stockymcstock

This exercise simulates a message interface of :-

* type 1: Stock Name, price
* type 2: Stock Name, price, quantity
* type 3: Stock Name, Adjustment Type (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplier), adjustment value

It contains a main class, and a set of unit tests for this. It's loosely based on another example I produced sometime ago, which is here:

https://github.com/lukecampbell999/simplestocksdemo

This project may be built using Maven (mvn clean install)

And the main class is :-

com.lukecampbell.simplestocks.StockyMcStockFace (I guess a little humour won't go wrong, eh?) :)


Normally, I would use the standard layout of 

src/main/java
src/test/java

but since this is a simple POC product, I've just included an SRC directory.
