# stockymcstock

Normally, I would use the standard layout of 

src/main/java
src/test/java

but since this is a simple POC product, I've just included an SRC directory.

This project may be built using Maven (mvn clean install)

And the main class is :-

com.lukecampbell.simplestocks.StockyMcStockFace (I guess a little humour won't go wrong, eh?) :)
